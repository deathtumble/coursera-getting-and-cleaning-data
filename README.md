# Getting and Cleaning Data 
# Coursera Data Science Specialization

## Course Project

### Objectives

This is one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### How to use this project

1. Download or clone this project locally.
2. Change to the git project in RStudio
3. Run ```source("run_analisys.r")``` in RStudio.
    * this will download the required zip file of raw data is not already done
    * unzip the raw data locally id not already done.
    * produce a tidied data set from the raw data of a mean of all the mean feature for each activity and subject
